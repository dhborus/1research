Summary: 

### Meaning of Political Freud

[# MP] a political intervention and an effort to capture an "extra" dimension of capitalism -- flowing from marginal and outlying groups in America -- black, Jews, women. Schema is a shift from productive to consumption in which the family serves different function. Political Freud here is meant to convey both a way of understanding history and as a product of history. [@zaretsky2017, p. 2-6]

### Regression and the Interpretation of Dreams  [[Brill_IOD]]

(#DQ) If we call the direction which the psychic process follows from the unconscious into the waking state progressive, we may then speak of the dream as having a regressive character.

Zaretsky comment -- human history implication -- not a single progressive surface but active layers "formed in the past to which we can return or *regress*.

Not progress versus decline as much as history unfolds at different levels and on different timescales-- points in the pass to which we regress, conflicts to which we return. [@zaretsky2017, p. 7-8]

### Conflicting Meaning

(#MP-Conclusion) two conflicting movements -- one where Freud clarified the irrational sources of domination and "affirmative moment" in which it became submerged in larger history and appeared to become obsolete.

Freudianism had been a theory of the mind, a paradigm for interpreting culture, and ethical commitment to self reflection.  First yielded to neuroscience, second university studies, third still up in the air. ^EzjJ^

Not religion -- since mss objective state than stimuli not directly registered but first dissolved and internally reconstituted as to give them personal, even idiosyncratic, meaning. No necessary connection between individual subjectivity and social order. Goal of analysis is not a particular value but rather analytic attitude.## African American political Freudianism

(#MP) PF opened inner world of damage and turned that memory toward politics. [@zaretsky2017, p.7]

### Psychoanalysis and the Spirit of Capitalism

Notes on Chapter One. p. 198 on what Adam Smith and political economy took for granted.

capitalism always required a spirit, have changed, second industrial revolution depended on charisma -- individuals who "motivate followers by giving personal expression to new goals or ideas." Interesting claim about the ideas -- neither reflect or cause change, serve as catalysts. Charisma guarantees that the aspirations and legitimations that accompany social change will be rooted at an inward and personal level. [@zaretsky2017, p. 17]

EZ terms psychoanalysis the Calvinism of the Second Industrial Revolution on the grounds of centrality of family relations and personal life. (Freud (in analogy to Jesus, leave your family (i.e. archaic image) for more enriched personal life. Accepts that little mention about economy per se and admits that Keynes with spending praise rather than saving pivotal. [@zaretsky2017, p. 18]

### Desire to be free from spirit of 19c capitalism

(#MP) for EZ, this is personal life -- having an identity distinct from one' place in the family, in society, and social division of labor. Key is historical specificity of separation of family and paid work meant new forms of privacy and intimacy. PI now a problem and project; analysis "theory and practice of this new aspiration for a personal life." [@zaretsky2017, p. 20]

### Cultural importance of analysis

(#MP) freeing of individuals from unconscious images of authority; unconscious and sexuality itself reconceived as beyond social and family place. sleeper completely separated from real world [really? day residue? point of interpretation?] "No thought that comes to the individual --whether it originated in childhood or comes from the 'day residues' . . . -- is directly registered; rather it is first dissolved and internally reconstituted in such a way as to give it a unique and contingent meaning." Psychoanalysis interprets through divorce from collectivities, and relate more affirmatively to their depths. [@zaretsky2017, 21]

### Freudian sexuality

(#MP) key shift -- sexuality not gender difference aimed at reproduction but distinction between libido and repression. interest in object choice. Psychoanalysis recognizes special individuality in capacity to love "in the conditions he or she sets up for loving and the in the impulses he gratifies by it, and in the aims he sets out to achieve in it." Offers key to breaking iron cage. [@zaretsky2017, p. 22-3]

### Three traits of Calvinism

calling (production for own sake not need per se), compulsion, acquisition. analysis qualified asceticism (through instinct), challenged repression, and circle of guilt. [@zaretsky2017, p. 25]

### New sense of autonomy

compare Kant (find universal moral code) to SF (personal goals through capabilities) followed by shift in analysis from defamiliarization to refamiliazation [@zaretsky2017, p, 27]

### Postwar Uses of Analysis

obviously new set of words, emphasis on mother, but also ethical responsibility -- now less a mater of observing universal moral norms than of meeting concrete obligations to particular others. Bloomsbury's transfamilial sociality. less id, etc. than attachment, loss, and mourning. England, of course.  
In US -- analysis took on responsibility and adulthood ethos, lined to a new maturity in America's global role. Key was the postwar rejection of radical politics and the insistence that freedom in the private realm." Arendt's totalitarianism takes to private sphere; old-fashioned tyranny just the public. Erikson's mature person who was "tolerant of differences, cautious and methodical in evaluation, just in judgment, circumspect in action, and capable of faith and indignation." [@zaretsky2017, p. 29-31]

### Analysis and Postwar Nuclear Family

stress on private life, normalized Keynesian welfare state. emphasized power from the inside of individuals. "Thus absorbed, ego psychology functioned as a form of social control."

New charisma to the family set out forces that couldn't fully be contained. domesticity took on the role previously reserved for personal life. "By the 1960s, aninomian upsurged inspired by a Freudian spirit would overflow the boundaries of the analytic profession, the heterosexual family, and the welfare state. Simultaneously normalizing and fuelded by charismatic sources, then, analysis was at the center of *both* the growing rationalization of personal life unfolding in the 1950s *and* the looming critique of rationalization, the charismatic rejextion of the mundane that came to the fore in the 1960s." [@zaretsky2017, p. 31-2]

### New Left Challenge

ideology of intersubjectivity, validation of narcissism, feminism. rejection of the durable unique personality and the so-called stigmatization. relational theories helped advanced post-Fordist information based capitalism with shifting networks, and deterritorialized flows. "The idea of a personal life interior to the individual was repudiated in favor of an emphasis on flexibility, sociality, and sensitivity to difference."

narcissism -- once obstacle autonomy now in favor expressiveness (which validated narcissism). validated an environment that produces relationships, not things -- and let image, personality, and interpersonal skills come to the fore.

aided by family revolution of the 1960s -- led to feminism treating psychologizing as social oppression. [@zaretsky2017, p. 35-6]

### legacy of Psychoanalysis

both emancipation and "pseudo-science." Makes sense . . . "when we realized that, on the one hand, it gave voice to the emancipatory aspiration that served as a critique of the first industrial revolution while, on the other, those aspirations were recuperated within a revised spirit of capitalism corresponding to the second." [@zaretsky2017, p. 37]

### Parallel between Hegelian master-slave stages and Black intellectual developments
key to argument that double conscious, identity as free person, master dependent and slave's consciousness exists for itself -- Harlem R, Pop Front, postcolonialism. tends to be more political and collective than with white as private. [@zaretsky2017, p. 39-40]

#### Comment
when Zaretsky writes, p. 40 that the blues are closely linked to psychoanalysis because they are the first real personal musical form -- the word link is doing quite a bit of work.

### Blues pain without self-pity
(#DQ) From Ellison -- The Blues as an  "impulse to keep the painful details and episodes of a brutal experience alive in one's aching consciousness, to ginger its jagged grain, and to transcend it, not by the consolation of philosophy but by squeezing from it a near tragic, near comic lyricism.''

### Follow up on Comment
blues were the construction of black memory. Psychoanalysis put memory at the center of all human strivings toward freedom. Less recall of objective knowledge of the past than the subjective process of mastering the past so that it becomes part of one's identity. [@zaretsky2017, p. 41]
