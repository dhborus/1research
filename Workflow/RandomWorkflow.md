### Upshot -- 05 April 2021

Decided to stick with Mac -- muscle memory and ease of use (the "just works" factor). Now the issue will be whether Sarah's Mac can be a usable machine. Or whether turning to a new silicon machine is the way to go.

Having trouble with autocomplete.bib, both pickers revert to Zotero after placing citation in Atom. Something of a pain.

Slowly becoming more attuned to Linux and have solved some problems. Have, for instance, gone back to out-of-the-box keybindings. Will need to check exchange with Mac ecosystem, however.

Zettlr works better with footnotes and has larger, more readable fonts. As of 4 April, has lost tab ability.

K-runner has ability to do wikipedia (wp: ), imdb (imdb: ) and google (g:) searches. Needs https:// to go to websites.

Will have to investigate fan and cooling behavior. May be the deciding factor, along with battery life (which on the 15‚Äù was hardly exemplary with the Mac.)

iCloud can be used for transfer, although it is hardly efficient. (Does mean that Mint or elementary is not ruled out, even if neither can do Nitroshare)

GitHub won't stage: 2021-04-04. And repeats problems of yesterday. Best to avoid and use Dropbox and iCloud to move between iPad and Linux machine. Reminder that most work should be done on laptop.

Not sure what the error message means. Set up a repository called Trouble. Just mirrored the old LinWrite. So now we've no communication with Working Copy and the tab on Zettlr seems not to work.

Things are missing, I suppose, but I don't do the high end stuff -- just surfing, research, writing. Was going to go with iPad, but still can't use pandoc on the device. Could have used Scrivener with Dropbox. (wonder if NextCloud would work), but there is something reassuring about plain text.

Thinkpad purchase? -- hmm. So far MacBook Pro working well with Manjaro. Not sure it is worth it for a more conducive keyboard. (At moment wondering why bpytop is not running.) Maybe 15" as base; 13" as mobile? Maybe. Insures iPad is a consumption machine.

Would want to find some use for keyboard. So maybe monitor as the purchase. At least we can try out Karen's discarded monitor with the 15" Pro. Or 13" with monitor for one-stop computing.
