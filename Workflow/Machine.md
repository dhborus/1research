**MacBook-monitor** – *Pros*: enables mobility and readability. Use of one machine means not dependent on synchronization through iCloud or Dropbox *Cons*: weak battery, inside Apple ecosystem, no streaming of ripped DVDs.

**iMac - iPad** – *Pros*: powerful, fixed, no need for upgrade. more screen real estate. Able to use mechanical keyboard*Cons*: iPad not a work machine, charging irritations, poor integration with new study.

**On Linux** – It is time consuming to learn and set up but it does enable me to get beyond Tim's clutches, at least for computing. Less true for phone – which may be the final straw. Should at least make up a laptop.

**3 March Conclusion** – iMac – Macbook Pro as Linux machine. Upgrading to silicon appeals to techno cutting edge, but really do I need it? How about saving money? Would be nice to have a working laptop with healthy battery, though.
