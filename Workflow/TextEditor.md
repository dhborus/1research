^TextEditor^ 

Because both Zettlr and Atom are markdown editors, differences are marginal. Issues are links, searches, storage, and PDF conversion:

**links**: Z reads Obsidian backlinks directly. Atom needs Atom notes and even then there are complications: must indicate the note and the directory.

**searches** Atom slightly more powerful

**storage** Atom more easily store in GitHub.

**ease of writing** Atom has dual editor; Zettlr needs kludges with Quick Look.[@richardson2010]

**conversion** Zettlr PDF requires YAML (which changes title if different from designated file name); Atom relies on pandoc in terminal.
